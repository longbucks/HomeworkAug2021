  <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
<p>Hello my name is Trishten Gregory and I attend Webster University as a Finance Major. I have had a passion for technology and an interest in development for quite some time. I wanted to take initiative and learn coding on my own because I believe that is a skillset that is in demand. I am amazed by what coding can do. I have tried many times to learn the language and understand conceptually what it means to problem solve. Being surrounded by many individuals who problem solve, inspires me to persevere.<br> These individuals told me I must put in countless hours into these concepts to fully understand them. One thing I have learned is Programming is not about knowing the language well but applying it in a situation that is helpful to the world. Coding is a problem-solving mechanism, and the language is the tools at your disposal. A friend of mine who has graduated from the savvy boot camp, showed me what hard work and dedication can do oneself. I am creating an application to improve individualsâ€™ ability to speak at functions such as interviews, pitches, and presentations.</p>
